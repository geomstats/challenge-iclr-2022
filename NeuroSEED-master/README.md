# NeuroSEED in Small Open Reading Frame Proteins

## Overview

The repository is organised in four main folders one for each of the tasks analysed. Each of these contain scripts and models used for the task as well as instructions on how to run them and the tuned hyperparameters found. 

- `Neural_SEED_smORFs.ipynb` is the submission .ipynb file. We recommend adapting the .py file to run locally after data generation from the .ipynb file.
- `hypersmorf` contains our written functions to evaluate and generate the encoder
