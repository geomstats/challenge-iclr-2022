    "The improvement of data-dependent heuristics and representation for biological sequences is a critical requirement to fully exploit the recent technological and scientific advancements for human microbiome analysis. This notebook presents Neural Sequence Distance Embeddings (NeuroSEED), a novel framework to embed biological sequences in geometric vector spaces that unifies recently proposed approaches. We demonstrate its capacity by presenting different ways it can be applied to the tasks of edit distance approximation, closest string retrieval, hierarchical clustering and multiple sequence alignment. In particular, the hyperbolic space is shown to be a key component to embed biological sequences and obtain competitive heuristics. Benchmarked with common bioinformatics and machine learning baselines, the proposed approaches display significant accuracy and/or runtime improvements on real-world datasets formed by sequences from samples of the human microbiome."

    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Dysfunctions of the human microbiome (Morgan & Huttenhower, 2012) have been linked to many serious diseases ranging from diabetes and antibiotic resistance to inflammatory bowel disease. Its usage as a biomarker for the diagnosis and as a target for interventions is a very active area of research. Thanks to the advances in sequencing technologies, modern analysis relies on sequence reads that can be generated relatively quickly. However, to fully exploit the potential of these advances for personalised medicine, the computational methods used in the analysis have to significantly improve in terms of speed and accuracy.\n",

    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "While the number of available biological sequences has been growing exponentially over the past decades, most of the problems related to string matching have not been addressed by the recent advances in machine learning. Classical algorithms are data-independent and, therefore, cannot exploit the low-dimensional manifold assumption that characterises real-world data. Exploiting the available data to produce data-dependent heuristics and representations would greatly accelerate large-scale analyses that are critical to microbiome analysis and other biological research. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most tasks in computer vision and NLP, string matching problems are typically formulated as combinatorial optimisation problems. These discrete formulations do not fit well with the current deep learning approaches causing these problems to be left mostly unexplored by the community. Current supervised learning methods also suffer from the lack of labels that characterises many downstream applications with biological sequences. On the other hand, common self-supervised learning approaches, very successful in NLP, are less effective in the biological context where relations tend to be per-sequence rather than per-token (McDermott et al. 2021)."

    "### Neural Sequence Distance Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we present Neural Sequence Distance Embeddings (NeuroSEED), a general framework to produce representations for biological sequences where the distance in the embedding space is correlated with the evolutionary distance between sequences. This control over the geometric interpretation of the representation space enables the use of geometrical data processing tools for the analysis of the spectrum of sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Classical microbiome analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcorso/NeuroSEED/master/tutorial/edit_diagram.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 3: The key idea of NeuroSEED is to learn an encoder function that preserves distances between the sequence and vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the task of embedding sequences to preserve the edit distance reveals the importance of data-dependent approaches and of using a geometry that matches well the underlying distribution in the data analysed. For biological datasets, that have an implicit hierarchical structure given by evolution, the hyperbolic space provides significant improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We show the potential of the framework by analysing three fundamental tasks in bioinformatics: closest string retrieval, hierarchical clustering and multiple sequence alignment. For all tasks, relatively simple unsupervised approaches using NeuroSEED encoders significantly outperform data-independent heuristics in terms of accuracy and/or runtime. In the paper (preprint will be available soon) and the [complete repository](https://github.com/gcorso/NeuroSEED) we also present more complex geometrical approaches to hierarchical clustering and multiple sequence alignment.\n",

    "## 2. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve readability and limit the size of the notebook we make use of some subroutines in the [official repository](https://github.com/gcorso/NeuroSEED) for the research project. The code in the notebook is our best effort to convey the promising application of hyperbolic geometry to this novel research direction."

    "\n",
    "As microbiome analysis is one of the most critical applications where the methods presented could be applied, we chose to use a dataset containing a portion of the 16S rRNA gene widely used in the biological literature to analyse microbiome diversity. Qiita (Clemente et al. 2015) contains more than 6M sequences of up to 152 bp that cover the V4 hyper-variable region collected from skin, saliva and faeces samples of uncontacted Amerindians. The full dataset can be found on the [European Nucleotide Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/text-search?query=ERP008799), but, in this notebook, we will only use a subset of a few tens of thousands that have been preprocessed and labelled with pairwise distances. We also provide results on the RT988 dataset (Zheng et al. 2019), another dataset of 16S rRNA that contains slightly longer sequences (up to 465 bp)."

    "\n",
    "**Edit distance**  The task of finding the distance or similarity between two strings and the related task of global alignment lies at the foundation of bioinformatics. Due to the resemblance with the biological mutation process, the edit distance and its variants are typically used to measure similarity between sequences. Given two string $s_1$ and $s_2$, their edit distance $ED(s_1, s_2)$ is defined as the minimum number of insertions, deletions or substitutions needed to transform $s_1$ in $s_2$. We always deal with the classical edit distance where the same weight is given to every operation, however, all the approaches developed can be applied to any distance function of choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task and loss function** As represented in Figure 3, the task is to learn an encoding function $f$ such that given any pair of sequences from the domain of interest $s_1$ and $s_2$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}ED(s_1, s_2) \\approx n \\; d(f(s_1), f(s_2)) \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the maximum sequence length and $d$ is a distance function over the vector space. In practice this is enforced in the model by minimising the mean squared error between the actual and the predicted edit distance. To make the results more interpretable and comparable across different datasets, we report results using \\% RMSE defined as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{% RMSE}(f, S) = \\frac{100}{n} \\, \\sqrt{L(f, S)} = \\frac{100}{n} \\, \\sqrt{\\sum_{s_1, s_2 \\in S} (ED(s_1, s_2) - n \\; d(f(s_1), f(s_2)))^2}\n",

    "\n",
    "This task consists of finding the sequence that is closest to a given query among a large number of reference sequences and is very commonly used to classify sequences. Given a set of reference strings $R$ and a set of queries $Q$, the task is to identify the string $r_q \\in R$ that minimises $ED(r_q, q)$ for each $q \\in Q$. This task is performed in an unsupervised setting using models trained for edit distance approximation. Therefore, given a pretrained encoder $f$, its prediction is taken to be the string $r_q \\in R$ that minimises $d(f(r_q), f(q))$ for each $q \\in Q$. This allows for sublinear retrieval (via locality-sensitive hashing or other data structures) which is critical in real-world applications where databases can have billions of reference sequences. As performance measures, we report the top-1, top-5 and top-10 scores, where top-$k$ indicates the percentage of times the model ranks the closest string within its top-$k$ predictions."

Taking as an example the RT988 dataset (6700 sequences of length up to 465 bases), optimised C code computes on a CPU approximately 2700 pairwise distances per second and takes 2.5 hours for the whole matrix. In comparison, using a trained NeuroSEED model, the same matrix can be approximated in 0.3-3s (similar value for the k-mer baseline) on the same CPU. The computational complexity for $N$ sequences of length $M$ is reduced from $O(N^2\\; M^2)$ to $O(N(M + N))$ (assuming the model is linear w.r.t. the length and constant embedding size). The training process takes typically 0.5-3 hours on a GPU. However, in applications such as microbiome analysis, biologists typically analyse data coming from the same distribution (e.g. the 16S rRNA gene) for multiple individuals, therefore the initial cost would be significantly amortised."

    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the introduction, we believe that the NeuroSEED framework has the potential to be applied to numerous problems and, therefore, this project constitutes only an initial analysis of its geometrical properties and applications. Below we list some of the limitations of the current analysis and potential directions of research to cover them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type of sequences** Both the datasets analysed consist of sequence reads of the same part of the genome. This is a very common set-up for sequence analysis (for example for microbiome analysis) and it is enabled by biotechnologies that can amplify and sequence certain parts of the genome selectively, but it is not ubiquitous. Shotgun metagenomics consists of sequencing random parts of the genome. This would, we believe, generate sequences lying on a low-dimensional manifold where the hierarchical relationship of evolution is combined with the relationship based on the specific position in the whole genome. Therefore, more complex geometries such as product spaces might be best suited.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type of labels** In this project, we work with edit distances between strings, these are very expensive when large scale analysis is required, but it is feasible to produce several thousand exact pairwise distance values from which the model can learn. For different definitions of distance, however, this might not be the case. If it is only feasible to determine which sequences are closest, then encoders can be trained using triplet loss and then most of the approaches presented would still apply. Future work could explore the robustness of this framework to inexact estimates of the distances as labels and whether NeuroSEED models, once trained, could provide more accurate predictions than its labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Architectures** Throughout the project we used models that have been shown to work well for other types of sequences and tasks. However, the correct inductive biases that models should have to perform SEED are likely to be different to the ones used for other tasks and even dependent on the type of distance it tries to preserve. Moreover, the capacity of the hyperbolic space could be further exploited using models that directly operate in the hyperbolic space (Peng et al. 2021). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-supervised embeddings** One potential application of NeuroSEED that was not explored in this project is the direct use of the embedding produced by NeuroSEED for downstream tasks. This would enable the use of a wide range of geometric data processing tools for the analysis of biological sequences. \n",
