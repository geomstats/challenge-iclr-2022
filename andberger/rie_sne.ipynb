    "  Visualizations are crucial to investigators trying to make sense of high-dimensional data. The most common output of a visualization is a two-dimensional plot (e.g. on a piece of paper or a computer screen), so we often call on a form of dimensionality reduction when working with high-dimensional data. The vast majority of dimensionality reduction techniques assume that data resides on a Euclidean domain, which presents a problem when data is not quite that simple. Data residing on Riemannian manifolds, such as the sphere, appear in many domains where either known constraints or other modeling assumptions impose a Riemannian structure . In such settings, how should one visualize data?\n",
    "  \n",
    "  There are many concerns and questions when visualizing Riemannian data. The first is generic: all dimensionality reduction tools amplify parts of the signal, while reducing the remainder. This is an inherent limitation, which should always be in mind when interpreting data visualizations. Since some loss of information is inevitable, should we then loosen our grip on the data or its underlying Riemannian structure when such is present? Gauss's *Theorema Egregium* [1] informs us that if the final plot is to be presented on a *flat* screen or piece of paper, then a distortion of the Riemannian structure is inevitable.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In practice, even if one accepts the limitations of a visualization, actual algorithms for visualizing Riemannian data are missing. In this paper, we develop an extension of the *Stochastic Neighbor Embedding* [2] method to Riemannian data and thereby provide one such tool. We call this *Riemannian Stochastic Neighbor Embedding*, or *Rie-SNE* for short. Our approach is quite general as it allows for embedding data observed on one Riemannian manifold to be embedded on another. This allows for mapping data from a Riemannian space to a two-dimensional Euclidean plane (for plotting), but also mapping to a two-dimensional sphere, or similar, when the Euclidean topology is inappropriate. Rie-SNE does not claim to solve the above-mentioned limitations of visualization, but it does provide a working tool, which we demonstrate to have practical merit.\n",

    "## Euclidean visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "General data visualization is a vast topic, and a complete review is beyond our scope [3]. We here focus on the setting where data is represented as vectors (points) in a Euclidean space of high dimension. When data is two- or three-dimensional a scatter plot can directly reveal its structure, and we focus on the more difficult setting where data dimensions vastly exceed the easily plottable. Here one may explore the data through multiple projections, such as pairwise scatter plots, which is usually manageable for data of up to around 10 dimensions. Eventually the approach tends to become unwieldy and the greater picture is lost. Alternatives include continuously interpolating between dimensions to provide an (interactive) animation [4].\n",
    "  \n",
    "The approach we here explore is to find a non-linear mapping from the high-dimensional observation space into a two- or three-dimensional space, which is suitable for plotting. Many variants of this approach exists, and we only touch upon a few. *Principal component analysis (PCA)* [5] is perhaps the most commonly used approach to dimensionality reduction. This seeks a low-dimensional representation of data that preserves as much variance as possible. The restriction to spanning a linear subspace of the observation space, however, often implies that the low-dimensional view reveal little structure. The *Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM)* [6] provides a nonlinear probabilistic extension of PCA that places a Gaussian process prior on the unknown mapping that reduce dimensionality, and marginalize this accordingly. The approach carries intrinsic elegance, but its optimization can be brittle [7]. Classic 'manifold learning' techniques avoid optimization issues by phrasing optimization tasks, where an optimum is available through spectral decompositions [8]-[10]. These rely on constructions of neighborhood graphs, which, however, can be brittle, so in practice the resulting visualizations are sensitive to parameter choices. The *stochastic neighbor embedding (SNE)* [2] replaces the 'hard' graph construction with a softer construction. A modern variant of this method [11] is one of the currently most popular algorithms, and is the one we here extend."

    "Finally, we can try a different Riemannian manifold, namely the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. Following Mallasto et al. [17] we consider the price of 10 popular crypto-currencies over the time period 2.12.2014 — 15.5.2018. As is common in economy [18] the relationship between prices is captured by a 10 × 10 covariance matrix constructed from the past 20 days. This gives rise to a time series of covariance matrices, each of which reside on the cone of symmetric positive definite matrices. Rie-SNE is used to produce visualizations on both the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$, showing a one-dimensional structure capturing the time-evolution behind the data. In contrast, tangent space PCA produce $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\\mathbb{R}^3$ visualizations showing little to no structure in the embeddings.\n",
